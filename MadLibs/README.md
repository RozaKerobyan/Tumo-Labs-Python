# Mad Libs 🏁

🔹 MadLibs has 3 texts that will randomly select someone and suggest you type whatever is in the brackets of the text.

🔸 After typing, it will output the story you typed

     🔻 I divided the file into 2 parts, because according to PEP8, the lines should not exceed 79.

🔹 I used `random` library

    ❗️ To see the result `libs.py` the file should be run
